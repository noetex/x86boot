# x86boot
MBR bootloader for x86-based processors.

## How to build:
### Prerequisites:
* Clang
* NASM
* QEMU (optional for testing)

### Steps
* Clone the repository
* Run the build script (build.bat for Windows, build.sh for Linux)
* Pass the output image to QEMU

## About Running
Although QEMU is used here, but this can be any x86 emulator as well.\
Or better than an emulator: try it on actual hardware! But do it at your own risk.
